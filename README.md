# Random JSON Generator

A command-line tool to generate random JSON strings. Expected to be useful for
testing other software. This project is amusing to myself because the initial
version is barely 100 lines of Go code and it still serves a real purpose,
also being a useful example for Go beginners (hopefully).

## Prerequisite

- Go (tested with `go1.19.1 linux/amd64`)

## Usage

```
git clone <URL-OF-THIS-REPO>
cd random-json
go run .
```

## NOTICE

Although the initial commit itself provides a basic working version, this
project is still a work in progress. Do not depend on the JSON generated by
this tool without making them pass through a validator first.
