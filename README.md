# Random JSON Generator

A command-line tool to generate random JSON strings. Expected to be useful for
testing other software.

## Prerequisite

- Go (tested with `go1.19.1 linux/amd64`)

## Usage

```
git clone <URL-OF-THIS-REPO>
cd random-json
go run .
```

## NOTICE

Although the initial commit itself provides a basic working version, this
project is still a work in progress. Do not depend on the JSON generated by
this tool without making them pass through a validator first.
